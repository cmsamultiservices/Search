# **App Name**: FileFinder

## Core Features:

- Document Indexing: Index documents using MiniSearch for real-time filtering. Documents are stored in a JSON file. The LLM will be used as a tool to reason about how often the file is updated.
- Real-time Search: Implement a search bar that filters documents in real time as the user types.
- File Link Generation: Generate 'file:///' URLs from the document's file path to open files directly.
- Document Display: Display search results in a list format.
- New Tab Opening: Open each file link in a new tab when clicked.
- Authentication: Allow users to optionally log in and access list of documents, or make their document lists private

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to reflect the straightforward and utilitarian nature of the application.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5), nearly desaturated hue of the primary, for a clean, uncluttered feel.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#FF9933) to highlight interactive elements and search results.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a clean, modern, and readable interface.
- A clean, single-column layout optimized for search input and clear display of results.
- Simple, monochromatic icons to represent file types.
- Subtle transitions for search results appearing and disappearing.
